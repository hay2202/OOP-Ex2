### **Welcome to Pokemon Game**

This project is implements Pok√©mon game based on weighted directed graph with graph theory algorithms.
In our game there are two automatic participants and they are: Agents (the red ones), Pokemon (the yellow ones).
The goal of the game is for the agent to catch as many Pokemon as he can to reach the highest score as possible. There are 24 levels the user can pick from [0-23], each containing its own graph, number of Pokemon and number of agent.
